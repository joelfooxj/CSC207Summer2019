Note:

Data for all database objects are saved as either Test<ObjectTypes>.bin files or <ObjectTypes>.bin.

This allows for one set of .bin files to be reset state files, and another set for testing.

When asked, "Do you want to import default test setup?":
- Yes will get data from the Test<ObjectTypes>.bin files,
- No will import data from the <ObjectTypes>.bin files.

When asked, "Do you want to override default test setup?":
- Yes will override data in the Test<ObjectTypes>.bin files, or new Test<ObjectTypes>.bin files will be created.
- No will override data from the <ObjecTypes>.bin files, or new <ObjectTypes>.bin files will be created.
